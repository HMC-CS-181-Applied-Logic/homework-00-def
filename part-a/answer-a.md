## Part a

### Describe what the code in `z3-test.py` is doing in a paragraph or two.

The code in z3 test.py is creating a boolean expression and adding it to a solver.
Then, the expression is outputted, whether the expression is satisfiable, and if it is, what a solution is.
Next, an additional condition is added to the solver, and the output is repeated.
For the first condition, we see it is satisfiable, with a set of values for all 4 variables.
Once the second condition is added, we the output tells us it becomes unsatisfiable.
